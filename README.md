Coded in Visual Basic .NET in Visual Studio, this game was created for a presentation at the Computer Science club at Fitchburg State University during the Spring 2014 semester.

Lingo is a game show that has aired off and on over the last three decades. Contestants guess five letter words in order to figure out the secret word, using clues picked up along the way.

This program is a two player version, where one player enters in a secret word, and the other attempts to guess the secret word. 

The guesser wins if they solve the word in five guesses or less. Otherwise, their opponent wins.

This program is a rather simplified version of Lingo. There is no scoring, timer, or word validation. It is up to the players to keep score, and to decide which words are legal and which words are not. On the other hand, this gives the players the opportunity to play the game however they see fit.

## Launching the game
The game can be played by launching the shortcut to the build version in the top level directory. Microsoft .NET Framework 4 is required.
